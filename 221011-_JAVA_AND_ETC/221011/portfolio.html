                <p>Currently producing 52 idols, and managing all kinds of chores in 765 production. I personally like this job but, some idols don't like me very much. They're a little harsh for me. Come to think of it, why are they so mean? Why do I have to endure all of this kinds of mental hazards? I want to cry. Maybe I'll meet my dear Chihaya to heal my mental wounds.</p>
